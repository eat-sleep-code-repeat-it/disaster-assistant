# ðŸŽ¥ DAGENT â€“ Final Project Demo Script

Hi! I'm excited to present my final project for the **Springboard AI for Programmers Mini-MBA**.

Iâ€™ve built an application called **DAGENT** â€” short for *Disaster Agent* â€” an AI-powered assistant that helps answer questions about **FEMA disaster declarations**.

---

## âœ… Purpose of the Application

DAGENT is designed to help **mortgage companies and financial institutions** verify whether a property is located in a **FEMA-declared disaster area**.

This verification is critical before offering disaster relief programs like **forbearance, deferrals, or loan modifications**, especially for **government-backed loans** like FHA, VA, USDA, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac.

Traditionally, this process involves manually reviewing FEMAâ€™s public datasets â€” which is slow, repetitive, and error-prone.

**DAGENT automates and simplifies this process** using natural language input and real-time AI-powered search over FEMA disaster data.

## ðŸ§  Key AI Features

The application demonstrates several important AI capabilities covered in the course:

- **Prompt Engineering** â€“ to guide how the assistant interprets and responds to user queries  
- **OpenAI Embeddings** â€“ to convert disaster records and user questions into semantic vectors  
- **Vector Databases** â€“ for fast and accurate similarity search  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** â€“ to inject relevant FEMA data into the modelâ€™s context  
- **Guardrails** â€“ to prevent the model from answering when no relevant data is found  
- **AI-based Evaluation** â€“ using GPT-4 to assess each answer for:
  - Relevance  
  - Accuracy  
  - Completeness  

The user interface is built using **Gradio**, making it easy to interact with the assistant â€” just like using ChatGPT.

## ðŸŒŸ Unique Aspects of DAGENT

What sets DAGENT apart are three things:

1. **Domain-Specific Use Case** â€“ It solves a real compliance problem in the mortgage and housing finance industry  
2. **Structured Outputs** â€“ Answers arenâ€™t just generic text â€” theyâ€™re grounded in actual FEMA declarations  
3. **Evaluation Built-In** â€“ Each response is automatically reviewed by GPT-4, giving users transparent feedback on response quality

---

## ðŸš€ Future Direction

Looking ahead, I plan to extend DAGENT by:

- Connecting it to **internal enterprise systems**  
- Using **Model Context Protocol (MCP Server)** to manage context across agents and build a larger agentic AI application

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Summary

DAGENT combines real-world data and advanced AI features to solve a practical, high-impact problem â€” with the flexibility to scale into enterprise-grade systems.

Thanks for watching!
