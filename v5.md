# ðŸŽ¥ Short Demo Script â€“ DAGENT (Disaster AI Assistant)

Hi! This is my final project for the **Springboard AI for Programmers Mini-MBA**.

I built an application called **DAGENT**â€”short for *Disaster Agent*.

## ðŸŽ¯ What DAGENT Does

DAGENT is an AI assistant designed to help mortgage companies and financial institutions **verify whether a specific location is part of a FEMA-declared disaster area**.

This kind of verification is essential before offering relief options like **forbearance, loan deferrals, or modifications**, especially on **government-backed loans** such as FHA, VA, or Fannie Mae.

Rather than manually digging through public FEMA records, users can now ask natural-language questions and get fast, accurate, structured responses.

## ðŸ§  Core AI Features

DAGENT combines several key AI techniques covered in the course:

- **Prompt Engineering** for effective question and answer formatting  
- **OpenAI Embeddings** to vectorize FEMA disaster records and user queries  
- A **Vector Store** for fast, similarity-based search  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide contextually relevant answers  
- **Guardrails** to ensure the system only responds when relevant data is available  
- **Evaluation tools** using GPT-4 to assess each answerâ€™s:
  - Relevance  
  - Accuracy  
  - Completeness  

The user interface is built with **Gradio**, making the app feel intuitiveâ€”like ChatGPTâ€”with clear displays of the user query, the AIâ€™s response, guardrail status, and evaluation metrics.

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Next

Looking ahead, I plan to evolve DAGENT into part of a larger, **agentic application ecosystem**.

Specifically, I want to:

- Integrate DAGENT with **internal enterprise systems**
- Use tools like **Model Context Protocol (MCP Server)** to manage multi-agent workflows and maintain shared memory across use cases

These future enhancements will help transform DAGENT from a standalone assistant into a robust component of a broader, enterprise-grade AI platform.

## âœ… Final Thoughts

DAGENT combines real-world data with practical AI tools to solve an important, compliance-driven problem in the mortgage and finance space.

Thanks for watching!
