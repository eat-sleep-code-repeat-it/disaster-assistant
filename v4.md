# ðŸŽ¥ Short Demo Script â€“ DAGENT (Disaster AI Assistant)

Hi! This is my final project for the **Springboard AI for Programmers Mini-MBA**.

I built an application called **DAGENT**â€”short for *Disaster Agent*.

## ðŸŽ¯ What DAGENT Does

DAGENT is an AI assistant that helps verify whether a specific location is in a **FEMA-declared disaster area**.

This kind of verification is critical for mortgage companies before offering relief programs like **loan forbearance or modifications**, especially for **government-backed loans** like FHA or Fannie Mae.

The traditional process is manual and time-consuming. **DAGENT automates it using AI**, offering a faster, smarter, and more user-friendly experience.

## ðŸ§  Key AI Features

For this course project, DAGENT implements several core AI techniques:

- **Prompt Engineering** for better interaction  
- **OpenAI Embeddings** to turn FEMA disaster records and user questions into vectors  
- A **Vector Store** for fast similarity search  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to bring relevant disaster records into the modelâ€™s context  
- **Guardrails** that prevent the system from answering if no relevant data is found  
- An **evaluation layer** using GPT-4 to rate answers on:
  - Relevance  
  - Accuracy  
  - Completeness  

It also uses **Gradio** to create an interactive, ChatGPT-style interfaceâ€”where users can ask questions, see structured responses, and view evaluation results.

## ðŸš§ Whatâ€™s Next (Post-Course Plans)

While DAGENT currently uses static FEMA data, I plan to expand its capabilities after the course by:

- **Dynamically pulling live FEMA data**  
- Using **Model Context Protocol (MCP Server)** to manage context across agent workflows  
- **Connecting DAGENT to internal systems**, making it part of a larger, enterprise-grade **agentic application**

These additions will allow DAGENT to go beyond a standalone tool and become a plug-in agent within a broader AI system.

## âœ… Final Thoughts

To sum up, DAGENT combines real-world data with advanced AI workflows to solve a meaningful problemâ€”and itâ€™s built to evolve.

Thanks for watching!
