# ðŸŽ¥ Short Video Demo Script â€“ DAGENT

Hi there! I'm excited to share my final project for the **Springboard AI for Programmers Mini-MBA**.

I built an application called **DAGENT**â€”short for *Disaster Agent*.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of the App

The goal of DAGENT is to help mortgage companies and financial institutions **quickly verify whether a property is located in a FEMA-declared disaster area**.

This is critical for offering disaster relief optionsâ€”like loan forbearance or deferralsâ€”especially on **government-backed loans** such as FHA, VA, or Fannie Mae.

Normally, this verification process is manual and slow. DAGENT uses AI to **make it fast, accurate, and user-friendly**.

## ðŸ§  AI Features Used

Under the hood, DAGENT leverages several AI capabilities covered in the course:

- **Prompt Engineering** to structure how questions are asked and answered  
- **OpenAI Embeddings** to convert FEMA records and user queries into vectors  
- A **Vector Store** for fast similarity search  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to bring relevant disaster data into the modelâ€™s context  
- **Guardrails** to refuse to answer if no relevant information is found  
- And an **AI evaluation layer** using GPT-4 to rate each answer for:
  - Relevance  
  - Accuracy  
  - Completeness

## ðŸš€ What Makes DAGENT Unique

A few things set DAGENT apart:

- It works with **real-world, publicly available FEMA data**, updated dynamically  
- It provides **structured responses**, not just plain text  
- Users can ask both **freeform questions** and **specific location-based queries**  
- It includes **real-time feedback and evaluation**, making the system more transparent and reliable  
- The entire app is built with **Gradio**, giving it a clean, ChatGPT-style interface

## âœ… Final Thoughts

So thatâ€™s DAGENTâ€”a disaster AI assistant that brings together practical data and cutting-edge AI to solve a real-world problem.

Thanks for watching!
