# üõ∞Ô∏è Spoken-Style Script ‚Äì Disaster AI Assistant (DAGENT) Final Project

Hi, and welcome to my final project demo for the **Springboard AI for Programmers Mini-MBA**.

Today, I‚Äôll walk you through an AI-powered application I built, called **DAGENT**‚Äîshort for *Disaster Agent*. Its main goal is to help automate the process of verifying FEMA disaster declarations.

---

## üéØ Why This Matters

When a natural disaster hits, the **Federal Emergency Management Agency**, or **FEMA**, issues an official declaration. This includes information like:

- The type of disaster  
- When and where it happened  
- And what kind of assistance is available  

This data is essential for **mortgage companies**, because it allows them to verify whether a borrower lives in an affected area. That‚Äôs important for offering relief programs like **forbearance, loan deferrals, or modifications**, especially for **government-backed loans**‚Äîlike FHA, VA, or Fannie Mae.

But here‚Äôs the problem: this data is published in large CSV files, and verifying it manually is time-consuming.

So I built **DAGENT** to fix that‚Äîwith AI.

## üß† What DAGENT Does

DAGENT is an AI assistant that allows users‚Äîlike loan officers or analysts‚Äîto ask natural language questions, like:

> "Was Harris County, Texas declared a disaster area in 2023?"

Behind the scenes, it uses multiple AI techniques from the course, including:

- **Prompt engineering**
- **Vector databases**
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**, or RAG  
- **Structured outputs**
- **Guardrails**
- And even **AI evaluation**

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works ‚Äì Step by Step

1. **First**, the app pulls the latest FEMA disaster data in CSV format from the FEMA website.

2. **Next**, each record is converted into a vector using **OpenAI embeddings**.

3. These vectors are stored in a **vector database**, allowing fast, similarity-based searches.

4. When a user types a question, the app:
   - Turns it into a vector
   - Searches for the most relevant FEMA records
   - Sends that context to OpenAI
   - And returns a helpful, human-readable answer

5. If there‚Äôs **no relevant match**, DAGENT has **guardrails** to refuse to answer, rather than guessing.

6. And to evaluate how well it‚Äôs doing, DAGENT uses **GPT-4 as a judge** to rate each response on:
   - Relevance  
   - Accuracy  
   - And completeness

## üñ•Ô∏è The Interface

The front end is built with **Gradio**, and it works just like ChatGPT. It displays:

- The user‚Äôs question  
- The AI‚Äôs response  
- Guardrail status  
- And evaluation metrics

This makes the tool easy to use and easy to trust.

## ‚úÖ Final Deliverables

This project includes:

- A fully working AI-powered web app  
- A clean and professional GitHub repo  
- And this short video demo showcasing the app‚Äôs purpose, how it works, and what makes it unique
