# üõ∞Ô∏è Disaster AI Assistant (DAGENT) ‚Äì Final Project Demo

Hi, this is my final project for the **Springboard AI for Programmers Mini-MBA**.

---

## üéØ Objective

The goal of this project is to create a disaster AI assistant application called **DAGENT**, which uses AI techniques from the course to answer questions about **FEMA disaster declarations**.

FEMA disaster declarations are official records that detail disasters recognized by the U.S. government. These include information like:

- Type of disaster  
- Location and dates  
- Type of assistance provided  

This dataset is critical for **mortgage companies**, who must verify whether a borrower‚Äôs property is in a declared disaster area before offering relief such as **forbearance, deferrals, or loan modifications**‚Äîespecially for **government-backed loans** like FHA, VA, USDA, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac.

## üß† DAGENT ‚Äì AI-Powered Verification

I created **DAGENT** to help automate and streamline this verification process. It features:

- **Prompt engineering**
- **Structured outputs**
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
- **Vector databases**
- **Evaluation techniques**
- **Guardrails and observability**

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Pull FEMA disaster declarations in CSV format from the official FEMA site.

2. **Vectorization**  
   - Convert each record to an **embedding vector** using OpenAI embeddings.

3. **Vector Store**  
   - Store vectors in a vector database for **fast similarity search**.

4. **User Interaction**  
   - A user inputs a **state + county** or a **freeform question**.
   - The app:
     - Embeds the query
     - Searches for similar disaster declarations
     - Sends relevant data as context to OpenAI
     - Returns a natural language response

5. **Guardrails & Evaluation**  
   - If no relevant data is found, the app **refuses to answer**.
   - Uses **GPT-4 as a judge** to evaluate:
     - Relevance
     - Accuracy
     - Completeness

6. **Frontend**  
   - Built with **Gradio**, the UI displays:
     - The user‚Äôs question  
     - The AI‚Äôs response  
     - Guardrail status  
     - Evaluation metrics
