# DAGENT - AI-powered Disaster Assistant

Ask Anything About U.S. FEMA Disaster Declarations.

## Coding
```bash
# requires Python 3.12.7

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate 

pip install gradio
pip install openai
pip install faiss-cpu
pip install python-dotenv

#python disaster_assistant.py 

venv\scripts\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# refactor
python -m app.main
python -m app.main --no-verify-ssl

```

### First step - Completed
- test venv and openai setup: test_setup
- download csv
    - for demo, we use a small subset of the originial csv to reduce API usage
- read declarations as structured date model from csv
- create index
    - for each structured disaster declaration, create embeddings using OpenAI Embeddings API.
    - Creates and populates a FAISS vector index from disaster declaration embeddings
- Store FAISS index and embeddings to disk
- Reload FAISS index and embeddings 
    - to avoid recomputing embeddings
    - to save a ton of time and API usage
- define structured outputs using schemas and models like Pydantic
### Second step - Completed
- setup gradio UI
    - take prompt from UI
    - display conversation
    - keep chat history in live session
    - auto scroll to the latest conversation

### Third step - Completed
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
    - Use embeddings to transform disater declaration into searchable, meaning-rich vectors
    - retrieval/search data from vector to enable enables semantic search
    - pass relevant context to openai to prevent AI hallucinations
- generate openai answer using structured outputs

### Fourth step - Completed
- ? observability for monitoring LLM behavior
- Evaluate answer using openai as judge from aspect of relevance, accuracy, completeness
- Guardrail to validate answer
    - Blocks short or irrelevant answers that don't mention keywords from the query
- Include top match records

### Five step - Completed
- transform complex AI tasks into reliable workflows through chainingâ€”breaking tasks into logical steps with defined inputs and fallback plans
- refactor to module based app instead of dooing everthing in one script
- create embedings in batch to save time and token usage
- use logger instead of print

## Project Structure
- Keep Gradio app logic clean and isolated
- Separate data/model logic from UI
- Make it easier to maintain, extend, or even deploy later (e.g., with FastAPI)

## Sample Prompts
```js
is there an active disaster in Washington County, Oregon? 
is there an disaster in Riverside, California? 
is there an active disaster in Riverside, California?
active fire disasters? 
give all fire disasters?
