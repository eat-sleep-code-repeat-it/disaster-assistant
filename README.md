# DEAGENT - AI-powered Disaster Assistant

This is a final project for **[Springboard AI for Programmers Mini-MBA (On-Demand)](https://my.sectionai.com/mini-mbas/e7306541-f1d2-4920-b40a-8233e628f2f1)**.

I have built an application called **DAGENT** â€” short for *Disaster Agent* â€” an AI-powered assistant that helps answer questions about **FEMA disaster declarations**.

You can see detail [implementation steps](/docs/DAGENT-implementation.md).

## Demo

- You can watch my [Demo Video](abc).
- You can listen my [presentation Audio](/docs/DAGENT-presentation.mp3).


## How to run by yourself

I have included a small size of the original dataset for demo purpose to reduce openai token usage. The original FEMA dataset is a large file containing all disaster declarations since they are recorded. 

The instructions are mainly writen for windows users since I only one windows laptop. You may follow the following instructions to run by yourself. 
 
- requires `Python 3.13.7`
- clone this repo (assuming you are in `c:/workspace` directory on windows)
- navigate to the application `cd c:/workspace/disaster-assistant`
- rename `.env.example` to `.env`
- open `.env` and replace `<your_openai_api_key_here>` with your openai key
- run the following command



```bash
# requires Python 3.13.7

# On macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate 

# On Windows
python -m venv .venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# install packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# run DEAGENT with SSL on
python -m app.main

# if you have SSL issue, run this istead to skip SSL
python -m app.main --no-verify-ssl

```

- Sample Prompts
```js
is there an active disaster in Washington County, Oregon? 
is there an disaster in Riverside, California? 
is there an active disaster in Riverside, California?
active fire disasters? 
give all fire disasters?
```

## Project Structure
- Keep Gradio app logic clean and isolated
- Separate data/model logic from UI
- Make it easier to maintain, extend, or even deploy later (e.g., with FastAPI)
